=====File description======

Method - this class handles all method related lines.
RegularExpressions - a class to obtain all the necessary regular expressions. this class also creates all the
Patterns needed for the rest of the solution.
Scope - a class to organize the code, handles a scope of code. handles simple scope and an if/while scope
Sjavac - the main function, calls for a global round and a methods round and handles exceptions
SjvacExceptions - the exception that we throw in case of an error in the s-java file
Variable - a class to save all the necessary information of each variable
VariableFactory - a class to create a Variable instance easily
HashMapVariable - a data structure to save all the variables. - more information at the design

=====design========
Variable - The variable class design is based on the mode design pattern. Each variable created should behave
differently based on its Type, whether or not its initialized of whether or not its Final. So we decided
instead of creating an abstract class for variable and then implement it for each different type and for final
or not and for initialize or not, to create a variable with those modes and the variable behaves according to
its modes.
VariableFactory - because of the different behaviours according to the modes, and to keep the code adjustable
and simple we created the Factory. the factory receives the information about the variable and make sure that
the variable its creating will behave accordingly. For example, it gets the type and create a list of all
allowed types to be assigned to that variable as well as a Pattern list that help us decide if an assignment
is valid or not.
HashMapVariable - The HashMapVariable contains 2 HashMaps<varName, Variable> one for the current scope and
another for the outerScope. Variable from each map should behave differently, that is why we decided on that
structure. Each scope our code gets into a copy constructor deep copy the last scope's HashMapVariable. that
way we make sure that when the scope closes, all variables get back to the status they were before, as
instructed.
Method and Scope - At first we though that the flow of the code should be in Sjavac. However the code became
long and it was getting tough to understand it or its flow. So we decided to split the code into logical
classes, each handles a specific part of the code.
methods data structure - HashMap<methodName, argumentsTypes>, we save at the global run all the methods in
this data structure, so that when called we can compare the argument types with the variables supplied to the
function call.


====Implementation issues====
Our most time consuming task of this exercise was to decide on the Variable and HashMapVariable design. it was
challenging because that as we kept reading the instructions again and again, we continued to encounter more
and more behaviours that we wanted to come up with a design that satisfy all of them.
One of the issues we faced was to save all the global variables and methods in the global run and not saving
them on the methods run while not duplicating code. We could copy and paste a lot of code with small
differences but we decided to have a boolean argument called globalRun which indicate if we are on a global
run or not. In order to achieve the wanted behaviour we had to add if's and else's so some methods became a
bit long. Eventually we divided those methods.

=====Exceptions======
We decided to use exceptions in order to handle the errors in the s-java file. We decided to so because of the
exception mechanism. First of all if we had returned a value that indicates a success or a failure we will be
giving up the option to return something else, like the rest of the line in many cases. Another reason is the
simplicity the exception solution gives us in this case, if there is an error, i know that the answer is 1 and
it doesn't matter what comes next in the file, so its very natural to exit the program and to propagate the
exception to the main.
We though of creating 3 types of exceptions one for syntax, one for wrong type, and one for null argument
usage. However we came to the conclusion that there will be no difference between those exceptions and there
handling so we created only one class with multiple error massages to chose from.

=====Questions====
6.2.1 In order to modify out solution to support another types all changes should take place in
VariableFactory
and RegularExpressions. In regular expressions, you should add the relevant regex for that type and the name
of that type to the types regex. In VariableFactory all you need to do is to add a possible type list for
that type so that the Factory can construct it. All of that could be in VariableFactory however we decided to
use the RegularExpression class to create some order in out code. If the new type values consist of
characters other then {0-9.-+} then the extra characters should also be added to a regex checking for a valid
assignment.
6.2.2 In order to create different method return types we need to do the following:
        1. In the methods HashMap we would save as the first argument to be the return value of the method.
        2. we would have to check in the CompileAssignment method if a var was assigned with a method call, if
         so we need to save that var type and compare it with the first argument saved in line 1.
      In order to add Using methods of standard java for example System.out.println:
         If the question referred to functions that need no import and we can know them all in advance, then
         all we need to do is to add them (and their arguments type) to the method HashMap at the main
         function, meaning to add a method that adds a lot of pre known methods name and arguments to
         initialize the methods data structure with the known standard java methods.

6.3
regularExpression1: "((?:[a-zA-Z][_\\w]*)|(?:_[_\\w]+))"
This regular expression check it a string is a valid argument name. It has 2 options: 1. That name starts with
 a letter, then the next characters can be {_a-zA-z0-9} even zero times. 2. That name starts with _ and then i
  must contain at least one more char from the group {_a-zA-z0-9};
regularExpression2: "(?:"+ALL_BOOLEAN_REGEX + "|" + VAR_NAME_REGEX + ")"
   ALL_BOOLEAN_REGEX contains all the possible boolean constant values (true, false, int and double)
   ALL_BOOLEAN_REGEX = "(?:" + IS_BOOLEAN + "|" + IS_DOUBLE + "|" + IS_INT + ")";
   VAR_NAME_REGEX is regularExpression1.
   notice that all the brackets in this expression start with ?: that's because that we wanted to get the
   variable name (if its a variable name) so that the next step of the program is to check if its a boolean
   supporting type and if its initialized.

=====Testing======

Test_001
checks a lot of scenarios were the code is correct and should return 0.


// from here all the tests should fail and return 1

checks if given the same name to different types.


Test_004
checks given twice "+" sign to a int.
